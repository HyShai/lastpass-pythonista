LastPass Pythonista
===================

**Original**: [lastpass-python][] (adapted for iOS - [Pythonista][])


Uses Pythonista to allow for pseudo x-callback-url functionality for LastPass. It downloads your LastPass vault and stores it in [Pythonista's keychain][]. You can then use Pythonista's powerful scripting coupled with an app such as [Launch Center Pro][] to make the LastPass iOS experience much more bearable.

**Note:** This does a one-way read-only sync from LastPass using an __unofficial__ API - if you want to manipulate your vault in any way (delete/edit) you must use the official [LastPass iOS app][] (requires a LastPass Premium subscription - $12/yr).


There are 2 ways to import your accounts:

1. save the encrypted blob locally
2. save your accounts to the `keychain`

The advantage to using the encrypted blob is that your accounts are not saved to the `keychain`. Although the `keychain` is encrypted, there *may* be ways to access it from other apps. Please weigh the risks before using this. 

The advantage to using the `keychain` is that it is a bit faster and you are not prompted for the lastpass master credentials each time that the blob is opened. You should set [`keychain.set_master_password`][] for additional security.

By default `lpfinder.py` will look for `.lastpass.blob` first and fallback to the `keychain`. If you want to use the `keychain`, run the import again and choose "Save to keychain" when prompted. If you want to switch to the blob run the import again and choose "Don't Save to keychain".

    `mkdir lastpass`<br>
    `cd lastpass`<br>
    `git clone https://github.com/HyShai/lastpass-pythonista.git`

Or

* Download the zip of this repo and sync to Dropbox.
* Download it to Pythonista using [DropboxFilePicker][] or [DropboxSync][].
* Unzip it using [Shellista][].

### Usage:

1. Import your accounts by running `lpimport_api.py`
2. To use it in an x-callback-url manner run `lpfinder.py` which takes 2 arguments - `account_name` and `redirect_url`
3. Tap the account for which you want the password 
4. The password will be copied to the clipboard and you will be redirected to the url/app that you passed in
4. Use `lpimport_api.py` to manually update your accounts (read-only)

If you want to use the encrypted blob, you can optionally save your lastpass master credentials to the `keychain` for convenience - **though this entails the same risk as above**. 

* Save your email as service=lastpass_email, account=lastpass, password={{your-email}}. 
* Save your password as service=lastpass_master, account=lastpass, password={{your-password}}. 

The names of the service and account are definite - see [lpfinder.py][] if you want to change them. See [keychain.set_password][]
